<h3>PRIVACY POLICY </h3>

<small> The LIG is very attentive and vigilant regarding personal data protection (DCP) issues. Univ. Grenoble Alpes has also appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) for ensuring that labs such as LIG comply with the <a href=" https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj" target="__blank">European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>.</small>

<br />

<h4>These data are as follows: </h4>

<small>We collect information the user shared with ad platforms such as Facebook, as well as information that platform such as Facebook inferred about the user based on his actions.  We collect this information from Ad Preferences Pages such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/" target="__blank">https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/</a> and the user’s Facebook timeline.. </small>
<br />

<small>Specifically:</small>
	<ul>
		<li><small>We collect the ads a user receives while she browses Facebook, the ads the user clicked on and the accompanied explanations that Facebook provides as well as the posts that link to a news organizations and the posts that are public.</small></li>
		<li><small>We collect several ad and post engagement proxies. We collect the time the ad/post was present on the screen of the user.  For comparison, we collect how much time each post in a user’s Facebook timeline was visible on the screen without collecting anything else regarding the post. When the user enters the area of an ad, we collect the (x,y) position of the mouse and the type of movement (scroll, move, click). We collect the actions of users on ads/posts: reactions (e.g., I Like, I love, Haha); comments (e.g., click on the comment button, writing a comment);  click on share;  actions on the content of the ad (e.g., click on the image of the ad, click on next image when there is a carrousel, access to the landing page); actions on the advertisers (e.g., verification of the advertiser when hovering over the name and the logo, access to the Facebook page of the advertiser); other actions (e.g., save the post, mask the post, signal the post, click on the “Why am I seeing this ad?”, click on Embed, activation of notifications).</small></li>


		<li><small>We monitor a precise set of news sites, and we collect the news articles a user is reading and the time the user spend on checking the news articles.</small></li>


		<li><small>We collect hashed versions of the email and the Facebook ID of a user, if the user shared this information with ad platforms such as Facebook. We use this information to target the user with ads and send surveys.</small></li>


		<li><small>We might collect the birth place and information about where the user lived, if the user shared this information with ad platforms such as Facebook or if the ad platform inferred this information indirectly.</small></li>


		<li><small>We might collect professional information about the user, if the user shared this information with ad platforms such as Facebook or if the ad platform inferred this information indirectly.</small></li>


		<li><small>We might collect financial and economic information about the user, if the user shared this information with ad platforms such as Facebook or if the ad platform inferred this information indirectly.</small></li>



		<li><small>We might collect localization information about the user, if the user shared this information with ad platforms such as Facebook or if the ad platform inferred this information indirectly.</small></li>


		<li><small>We collect information about the connection (such as IP address, browser type, operating system).</small></li>


		<li><small>We collect information related to the Internet.</small></li>


		<li><small>We collect information that helps us monitor the health of our application such as whether the user installed an ad blocker and when the users is connecting to Facebook.</small></li>


		<li><small>In addition, the participants in this study may be asked to fill out additional surveys, we will store their answers in our database.</small></li>

	</ul>


<small>	Ads, their explanations, posts and the attributes appearing in the Ad Preferences Pages that we collect, might reveal information relating to a user’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, criminal convictions, sex life or sexual orientation, or certain types of genetic or biometric data that is known as ‘special category’ data. This data is inferred by Facebook and similar platforms and it might not be accurate. In addition our surveys may ask participants for their socio-economic profile and personality traits.</small>
