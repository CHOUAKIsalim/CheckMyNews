            <small> Inria is very attentive and vigilant regarding personal data protection (DCP) issues.

              </ul>


            <small> Ads, their explanations, and the attributes appearing in the Ad Preferences Pages that we collect, might reveal information relating to a user’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, criminal convictions, sex life or sexual orientation, or certain types of genetic or biometric data that is known as ‘special category’ data.
