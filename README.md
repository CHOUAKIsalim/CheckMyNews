# CheckMyNews


CheckMyNews is a tool developed by the MIAI Multidisciplinary Institute on Artificial Intelligence in Europe that allows users to donate data about the posts that are shown in their Facebook timeline. 

This is a tool developed by academics to monitor what information gets amplified on social media platforms and measure if there are systemic biases in the quality of information users receive on Facebook from news medias among different socio-demographic groups.  

Our monitoring tool works silently in the background while you are browsing Facebook without any overhead to your browsing experience. The tool collects information about the content you RECEIVE on your timeline and does not collect information about the content you SHARE on Facebook. We collect information about organic and sponsored posts from news medias you see on Facebook (e.g., we will collect the posts you see that are coming from nytimes.com); we are not collecting your personal comments, messages or the photos and content you share (please check the Privacy Policy for a detailed description of the data we collect). All data is pseudonymized and we do not send to our servers any personally identifiable information (e.g., your email, name, phone number). Our universities are very attentive and vigilant regarding personal data protection issues, and our monitoring tool has been verified by our universities and meets the highest standards in terms of security and privacy.
